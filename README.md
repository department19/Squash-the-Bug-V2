Squash-the-Bug V2 is simple point and click web game coded in only HTML, CSS and JS where in similar format to the traditional "whack-a-mole" game, the user will click on the bugs that will appear randomly in the "holes" of the game area to "squash" them and gain points in doing so.

V2 will focus on having an increasing difficultly based on an increasing level dependant on whether the user is able to meet the score requirement to proceed to the next level which I was not able to implement in first iteration. Secondary to this, an overhaul of the UI and structuring the webpage to create a more intuitive experience for the user.

The core components of the game and JS relating to them from the first iteration will be used as the basis for V2 with the hopes of either being able to attach the new features onto the preexisting code or altering the code to allow additional functions to be able to slot in as a callback. If neither of those options are possible, blocks of code will need to be revamped.

I decided to make this "whack-a-mole" style game as having the mouse input as the main interactive element because it felt more intuitive to me as someone who enjoys shooter games where the mouse is the main input.

## Components
### UI Elements
- Navigation bar to with links to open my web portfolio and the git hub repo of the web game
- A "header" page that will cover the whole viewport with the title, short description and maybe some sort of visual tutorial. This will translate out of view to the top of the page to reveal the game.
- A game area where there will be a varying number of "holes" for the bugs to appear for the user to click on.
- A side panel to display:
	- A timer
	- Current level
	- score and score required
